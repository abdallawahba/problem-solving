# Problem-Solving (For Beginners)

This repo brings together my solutions to some easy coding challenges I encountered while learning different programming languages for the first time (C++, Python). Most of the challenges are from Codeforces and HackerRank. I hope it's helpful! ðŸ˜Š

**P.S.** I will update this repo whenever I practice problem-solving.
